						<h2>Info</h2>
                        <p>Here is my most up-to-date resume:</p>
						<a href="resume.pdf">Resume - Christian Loth<br><br><br><br></a>
						<p>I have loved working with computers ever since I was a little boy. All of the small integrated devices and software built on them really sparked my interest and made me want to pursue the field of computer engineering. With the rapidly growing field of computer engineering, there are endless possibilities of what projects and contributions can be made. This past summer, I had an internship for an investigation’s software company called ShadowDragon. This company makes software which can monitor social media, open-source intelligence, and traffic on the dark net. I mainly focused on the social media software which is able to graph and display correlations of connections in people to show the possibilities of how people would interact. I worked on a part which checks if each social media endpoint is up and running by writing both batch and python scripts to integrate with a software called Nagios. I would also make robot Facebook accounts so that their software was able to look up things on Facebook, since you need to have an account in order to search for anything.<br></p>
						<p>I have also worked on many projects in the past. I wrote a flight plan calculator program in C# which can calculate many different components of flying a plane on a course like magnetic deviation, true heading, and much more. This is very applicable in the pilot world because of all of the factors that go into getting a plane to where it needs to go. I have also helped out with designing the webpage for the men’s organization Aggie Men’s Alliance that I’m in. On this webpage, there has to be a portal for people to pay dues, sign up for recruitment information, contact the executive office, and much more. I have also been a teacher’s assistant for the freshman intro to Engineering 102 class. As a TA, I would teach the freshmen how to code in python and answer any questions that they had.</p>
